# Accessing private attributes with name mangling
# Name mangling process helps to access the class variables from outside the class
# Using a dunder prefix for a class object will 'mangle' or destroy the attribute, and modified
# Every attribute with double underscore will be changed to _object._class_variable
# Practice should be refrained

print(f"Salary expectations:{s1._Student__salary}")
# Prints Salary expectations: 50,000
